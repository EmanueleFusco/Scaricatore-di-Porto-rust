# DECISIONS

Questions, deviations, spec ambiguities and everything marked `TODO(verify)` that could not be
verified. Append only.

## 2026-10-12 — M0-A (skeleton, settings, i18n, theme, shell UI)

### D1 — Frontend: plain Vite + Svelte, **not** SvelteKit

`PHASE_PROMPTS.md` M0-A step 1 says to scaffold with "the official Tauri v2 Svelte-TS template",
which currently means SvelteKit + `adapter-static`. The production build of that template contains
an **inline `<script>`** (SvelteKit's SPA bootstrap) in `index.html`, which the strict CSP of
`tauri.conf.json` (`script-src 'self'`) blocks — the shipped app would show a blank window.

The spec itself (spec §1) asks for "TypeScript + Vite + **Svelte**", never for SvelteKit, and
AGENTS.md §6 asks for a *light* frontend with no framework runtime. So the frontend is plain
Vite + Svelte 5 with a ~40-line path router (`src/lib/router.svelte.ts`). Consequences:

* strict `script-src 'self'` works as-is (verified: `dist/index.html` has no inline `<script>`),
* production payload drops from ~130 KB of SvelteKit runtime to **70 KB JS + 7.7 KB CSS**,
* one less dependency; `@sveltejs/kit` and `@sveltejs/adapter-static` were removed.

Cost: routing is ours, so it only supports the paths we actually add. That is fine for an app
shell with two screens and it grows with the code that needs it.

### D2 — Plugins added

`dialog`, `opener` and `single-instance` are registered (all on the spec §1 allow-list).
`dialog` is not used by any M0-A screen yet but is needed by M0-C (folder picker) and M1, and it
is zero extra binary weight. `single-instance` implements spec §3 "a second launch focuses the
first window". **No `tauri-plugin-shell`** (spec §1 forbids it). The `deep-link` feature of
`single-instance` is deliberately **not** enabled: it pulls in `tauri-plugin-deep-link` and the
command-line/protocol URL forwarding it provides belongs to a later phase.

### D3 — Devtools are off in release builds without a config flag

Spec §11.1 asks for "devtools off in release". `app.windows[].devtools` in `tauri.conf.json` would
also disable them in `tauri dev`, which would hurt development. Instead the **`devtools` cargo
feature is not enabled** on the `tauri` crate, so wry's devtools API is not compiled into release
builds at all. Nothing was set in `tauri.conf.json`.

### D4 — Lenient enum deserialisation in `Settings`

A strict `#[derive(Deserialize)]` on `language`/`theme` turns a single bad value
(`"theme": "ultraviolet"`) into "corrupt file", which moves the whole document to `.bak` and
resets *every* setting. Spec §2.8 asks for resilience, so unknown values degrade to the default
instead (`de_theme` / `de_language` in `state.rs`), and values are matched
case-insensitively after trimming.

### D5 — Wire format is camelCase

`Settings`, `SettingsView`, `Recovery` and `ErrorInfo` all serialise with
`#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` so the TypeScript side can use the names as-is. The
persisted `settings.json` therefore also uses camelCase keys.

### D6 — Settings file is only created on the first write

Loading a missing file returns defaults **without** creating the file. Writing always creates it.
This keeps the first launch free of disk writes; the trade-off is that a fresh install has no
`settings.json` until the user changes something.

### D7 — `npm run dev` outside Tauri degrades gracefully

`src/lib/stores/settings.svelte.ts` detects the absence of the Tauri IPC bridge
(`__TAURI_INTERNALS__`) and falls back to in-memory defaults instead of showing an error banner.
This makes UI work possible in a normal browser (`http://127.0.0.1:1420`), which is how the
screenshots in PROGRESS.md were taken. Inside the real app the backend stays the only source of
truth.

### D8 — CI, `tools.manifest.json` and the wizard are not part of M0-A

`PHASE_PROMPTS.md` M0-A does not ask for them; `.github/workflows/`, `tools.manifest.json` and the
first-run wizard belong to M0-C. `scripts/` is therefore still empty.

### D9 — `original_python/` is kept as-is

The layout in `AGENTS.md` §3 only lists `reference/ScaricatoreDiPorto.py`. The rest of the upstream
repository (`LICENSE`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `images/`) was left at the root under
`original_python/` instead of being deleted, because it is the user's source material and the
Python file's licence may matter for the About screen (§11.8).

### D10 — Wayland: worked around in the dev launcher, not "fixed" in the app

On the owner's machine (CachyOS, KDE Plasma 6.7.5, Wayland, NVIDIA RTX 3080, `webkit2gtk-4.1`
2.54.1, `gtk4` 4.24.1) any GTK window dies immediately with
`Gdk-Message: Error 71 (Errore di protocollo) dispatching to Wayland display`.

**Verified it is not our code**: the pristine `create-tauri-app` Tauri template, built and run on
the same session, dies with the identical message.

There are in fact **two** separate problems here, and the second one only showed up when the owner
ran the app for real:

| symptom | cause | fix |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Error 71`, process dies, no window | GTK4 against this compositor | `GDK_BACKEND=x11` |
| window opens but is **black on screen**, log shows `Failed to create GBM buffer` | WebKitGTK cannot allocate the NVIDIA GPU buffers via GBM | `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` (spec §13.3) |

With both set the app stays alive, the GBM messages disappear entirely and the log is empty.
**Whether the window is actually visible on screen still has to be confirmed by the owner** — the
screenshot tool available here (`magick import -window`) reads the X11 backing buffer and bypasses
the compositor, so it reports correct pixels even when the compositor shows black.

So `scripts/run-dev.mjs` (exposed as `npm run app`) injects **both** variables only when all of
these hold: Linux, a Wayland session, XWayland available, and the user has not already set
`GDK_BACKEND`. It prints what it is doing. This is deliberately not hidden inside the Rust code:
if a future GTK fixes the crash, the workaround disappears on its own instead of masking a real
problem, and on machines where Wayland works nothing changes.

Known follow-up (not M0 work): if other Wayland desktops hit this, the right fix is in the app —
detect the failure and tell the user to retry with `GDK_BACKEND=x11` — not in the user's shell.

### Open questions (owner)

* Tier 1 assumption of spec §1.1 (Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS Apple Silicon) is still a
  *guess* — nobody has confirmed it yet. It should be stated explicitly in the README.

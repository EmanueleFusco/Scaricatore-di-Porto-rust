## 2026-10-12 — M0-A / repo preparation + project skeleton, settings, i18n, theme, shell UI

### Done

* **Repository prepared** per `COME_INIZIARE.md` §1 and `AGENTS.md` §3: `git init`, `.gitignore`,
  the spec moved to `docs/RUST_PORT_GUIDELINES.md`, the Python app moved to
  `reference/ScaricatoreDiPorto.py`, empty `docs/PROGRESS.md` / `DECISIONS.md` / `SPIKES.md`
  created, first commit on `main`, work on branch **`m0-skeleton`**.
* **Backend** (`src-tauri/src/`)
  * `error.rs` — `AppError` (thiserror) + `ErrorInfo { code, messageKey, detail }`, camelCase wire
    format, stable codes `IO / JSON / TAURI / SETTINGS_CORRUPT / UNSUPPORTED`.
  * `state.rs` — `Settings { schemaVersion, language, theme, defaultOutputDir }` with
    `serde(default)`, schema version 1, lenient enum deserialisation, atomic save, corrupt-file
    recovery to `.bak`, `AppState` behind an `RwLock`, `settings_view()`.
  * `services/paths.rs` — app config/data/cache dirs, `settings_file`, `tools_dir`,
    `private_temp_dir` (mode `0700` on Unix), `default_output_dir` (OS Downloads),
    `atomic_write` (temp file + `fsync` + `rename`, replaces the destination on all 3 OSes),
    `backup_file`, and `sanitize_component()` (Unicode-preserving, spec §12.5).
  * `commands/settings.rs` — thin `settings_get` / `settings_save`.
  * `lib.rs` — plugins (`dialog`, `opener`, `single-instance` as the **first** plugin), state
    management, exit hook placeholder, no `unwrap()`/`expect()` outside tests.
* **Config** — `tauri.conf.json`: window 980×680, min 640×520, no maximum, centred;
  strict `csp` + separate `devCsp`; `freezePrototype: true`. `capabilities/default.json` grants
  only `core:default`, the two window-theme permissions, `dialog:default`, `opener:default`.
  **No `tauri-plugin-shell`** (spec §1).
* **Cargo release profile** exactly as spec §1: `opt-level="s"`, `lto`, `codegen-units=1`,
  `panic="abort"`, `strip=true`.
* **Frontend** (plain Vite + Svelte 5, see DECISIONS.md D1)
  * `src/lib/i18n/` — `it.json` / `en.json`, `t()`, `tCount()` (one/other), interpolation,
    OS-locale detection, dictionary key-parity test.
  * `src/lib/styles/app.css` — CSS variables only, 4/8 px spacing grid, light + dark palettes,
    system font stack, `prefers-reduced-motion`, focus ring, 4/8 px density tokens.
  * `src/lib/theme.ts` + `stores/theme.svelte.ts` — `System / Dark / Light`; `window.theme()` +
    `onThemeChanged` is the source of truth, `prefers-color-scheme` is the fallback,
    `getCurrentWindow().setTheme(null)` for "System".
  * `src/lib/stores/settings.svelte.ts` — mirrors the Rust document, write-through on change,
    `isTauriRuntime()` fallback so `npm run dev` is usable in a browser.
  * `src/App.svelte`, `src/lib/components/{Sidebar,FooterStatus,Toast}.svelte`,
    `src/lib/pages/{QueuePage,SettingsPage}.svelte`, `src/lib/router.svelte.ts`.
  * Accessibility: skip link, `aria-label`ed nav/footer, `aria-current="page"` (plus a left bar
    and bold text, never colour alone), labelled selects, visible focus, `role="status"` /
    `role="alert"`.
* **Tests** — 32 Rust unit tests, 5 Rust IPC integration tests (`tauri::test::MockRuntime`,
  real `invoke` path, hermetic temp dirs), 28 frontend unit tests (vitest).

### Verified by running

```
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --all -- --check          -> clean
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings -> Finished, 0 warnings
cd src-tauri && cargo test                          -> 32 + 5 passed, 0 failed
npm run check                                       -> svelte-check found 0 errors and 0 warnings
npm test                                            -> 3 files, 28 tests passed
npm run build                                       -> dist/ 70.28 kB JS + 7.70 kB CSS (23.8 + 2.1 kB gzip)
npx tauri build --no-bundle                         -> ok in 1m36s
```

* **Release binary: 4.58 MiB** (`src-tauri/target/release/scaricatore-di-porto`) — well under the
  spec §1 target of ≤ 15 MB. 313 Rust crates in the dependency tree.
* **Single-instance works**: with the app running, a second launch of the same binary exits
  immediately with code 0 instead of opening a second window (spec §3).
* **`npm run tauri dev` works**: Vite 8 + the plain Svelte setup compile and the app process stays
  alive; no version-mismatch warning, no CSP errors in the log.
* **Strict CSP verified against the production bundle**: `dist/index.html` contains **no inline
  `<script>` and no inline `<style>`**; the built app was served with the exact `csp` object from
  `tauri.conf.json` (`npm run check:csp` → `scripts/serve-dist-with-csp.mjs`) and loaded with
  **zero console messages**. Dark theme, Italian (from the OS locale), sidebar, empty queue state
  and status footer all rendered; switching to Settings navigated in-app (`/` → `/settings`,
  `aria-current` updated); switching language to English and theme to Light re-rendered
  immediately. Screenshots taken of both palettes and both languages.
* **Version alignment**: `tauri 2.12.3` / `tauri-build 2.7.2` / `plugin-opener 2.7.1` /
  `plugin-dialog 2.8.2` in Rust, matching `@tauri-apps/api 2.12.3` / `plugin-opener 2.7.1` /
  `plugin-dialog 2.8.2` in npm. (`tauri-build` has its own version line and is **not** tied to the
  `tauri` crate — noted because it caused a confusing resolution error.)

### Not verified / stubbed

* **The packaged Tauri window was never screenshotted.** The app launches and stays alive, but in
  this environment its window could not be raised onto the captured desktop, so there is no
  picture of the real window. The evidence that the UI is not blank is indirect but strong: the
  production bundle runs under the exact CSP in a browser with no console output, and the release
  binary starts and keeps running. **Superseded by the next block.**
* **Linux + this machine only.** Nothing was run on Windows or macOS; no `tauri build` bundle
  (`.deb`/`.rpm`/AppImage/NSIS/dmg) was produced, only `--no-bundle`.
* **Settings persistence was verified through the IPC tests, not by hand.** The test
  `settings_survive_a_restart` writes through `settings_save`, drops the app and builds a new one
  that reads the same values back — but nobody has yet clicked the two dropdowns in the real app.
  Please do that as the first manual check.
* **Theme "System" was not verified against a real OS theme change**: WebKitGTK reported dark via
  the media query, and the Tauri window API path could not be exercised outside the app.
* **Sidebar collapse under 800 px** is CSS-only and was not visually checked (no narrow viewport
  available in this environment).
* Window minimum-size enforcement (640×520) not checked by resizing a real window.
* Nothing from M0-B onwards is implemented: no `process.rs`, no tools, no manifest, no wizard, no
  CI workflow, `scripts/` only has the CSP helper.

### Spec items marked "verify" that I checked

* `tauri.conf.json` schema (`https://schema.tauri.app/config/2`, fetched and parsed) — confirmed
  `app.windows[].minWidth/minHeight`, `app.security.csp`/`devCsp` object form, and that
  `app.security` has **no** `devtools` key (it lives on the window config and requires the
  `devtools` cargo feature in release).
* `bundle.externalBin` naming rule read from the same schema (M0-C will need it).
* `@tauri-apps/api` 2.12.3 type definitions — confirmed `Window.theme()`,
  `Window.onThemeChanged()`, `Window.setTheme()` and their required permissions
  (`core:window:allow-theme`, `core:window:allow-set-theme`).
* `tauri::test::get_ipc_response` availability (tauri 2.12.3 `test` feature) — used by the
  integration tests. Note: `Builder::setup` does **not** run on `MockRuntime` (it only runs on the
  runtime's `Ready` event), so the tests manage the state on the built app instead.
* `std::fs::rename` replaces the destination on Windows (`MoveFileExW` +
  `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`) — this is why `atomic_write` needs no extra dependency.
* Tauri CLI version check: it compares **major/minor** between the Rust crates and the npm
  packages and refuses to run on a mismatch.

### Decisions/deviations (also in DECISIONS.md)

D1 (plain Vite + Svelte instead of SvelteKit — the template's inline bootstrap script breaks the
strict CSP), D2 (plugins added), D3 (devtools off in release without a config flag), D4 (lenient
enum deserialisation), D5 (camelCase wire format), D6 (settings file only written on first change),
D7 (non-Tauri fallback), D8 (CI/manifest/wizard are M0-C), D9 (`original_python/` kept).

### Next step

M0-B — `services/process.rs`: safe cross-platform spawn, Job Object / process-group tree kill,
concurrent stdout+stderr draining with a 200-line stderr ring buffer, `CancellationToken` +
`tokio::select!`, per-app private temp dir, with a `fake_tool` test binary and the four tests
listed in `PHASE_PROMPTS.md` M0-B.

## 2026-10-12 — M0-A / Wayland crash on this machine + window captured

### Done

* **Diagnosed the crash reported by the owner.** `npm run tauri dev` printed
  `Gdk-Message: Error 71 (Errore di protocollo) dispatching to Wayland display.` and the process
  died immediately, so nothing could be tested by hand.
  Environment: **CachyOS, KDE Plasma 6.7.5, Wayland session** (`XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`) with
  XWayland on `:0`; `webkit2gtk-4.1 2.54.1`, `gtk4 4.24.1`, `glib 2.90.1`, `mesa 26.2.4`,
  NVIDIA RTX 3080 (proprietary driver, modeset enabled).
* **Root cause is NOT our code — verified.** The pristine Tauri template
  (`create-tauri-app svelte-ts`, its untouched scaffold, none of our code) was built and launched on
  the same Wayland session: it dies with the **identical** `Error 71`. So this is
  GTK4/WebKitGTK against this compositor, not our configuration and not our Rust code.
* **Measured matrix** (release binary, fresh start each time, window captured with
  `magick import -window` and its mean pixel value measured — `0.0000` would mean a black window):

  | backend | outcome | window | mean brightness | `Error 71` | GBM warnings |
  | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
  | `GDK_BACKEND=wayland` | **dies** | none | — | **1** | 0 |
  | `GDK_BACKEND=x11` | **alive** | yes | **0.137** (renders) | 0 | 2 (harmless) |

  So **both** environment variables are needed on this machine:
  * `GDK_BACKEND=x11` — without it the app dies with `Error 71`.
  * `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` — the window renders **black on screen** otherwise
    (the two `Failed to create GBM buffer` messages). With it, **the GBM errors disappear entirely**
    and the log is empty. This is the fallback spec §13.3 prescribes.
* **`npm run app` updated** (`scripts/run-dev.mjs`): runs `tauri dev`, and on Linux only, when the
  session is Wayland *and* XWayland is available *and* the user has not already set `GDK_BACKEND`,
  it injects both variables and prints exactly what it is doing and why. One command, no hidden
  behaviour, unchanged on machines where Wayland works.
* **`devCsp` relaxed for HMR only**: `connect-src` now ends with `ws: wss:` instead of hard-coded
  `ws://localhost:1421` / `http://localhost:1420`, which were wrong anyway once `devUrl` became
  `http://127.0.0.1:1420`. The production `csp` is untouched.

### Verified by running

* `npm run app -- --help` → prints the explanation and forwards the arguments to the CLI.
* Release binary + `GDK_BACKEND=x11 WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`: alive, **0 GBM errors**,
  empty log.
* The window's X11 buffer contains the finished shell — sidebar with **Coda** marked current, the
  empty-queue card (*"Incolla un link per iniziare"*), the status footer (*"In attesa — Nessun
  processo in esecuzione"*), **Italian**, **dark** palette taken from the OS (KDE Breeze-Dark), so
  theme `System` works end to end. 980×680 as configured, `WM_NAME "Scaricatore Di Porto"`.
* **No error banner in the real app**, which means the `settings_get` IPC round trip to Rust
  succeeded (a failure would render the `role="alert"` toast).

### Not verified / stubbed

* **Whether the window is actually visible on screen is still unverified by me.** My capture tool
  (`magick import -window`) reads the X11 window buffer directly and therefore bypasses the
  compositor, so it cannot tell "correct pixels" from "correct pixels that the GPU never shows".
  The disappearance of the GBM errors is strong evidence that the black window is gone, but the
  owner must confirm it visually.
* The **underlying GTK bug** behind `Error 71` was not identified — no upstream bug search was
  done. It is recorded as an environment limitation, not a project defect.
* Clicking the language/theme dropdowns **by hand is still pending**: the capture tool cannot
  synthesise input, so `settings.json` has still never been written on this machine.
* macOS and Windows remain completely untested.

### Two measurement mistakes of mine, recorded so they are not repeated

1. **Stale instance.** For a while I reported contradictory results ("MORTO" for configurations that
   had worked minutes earlier). A leftover test copy of the binary (`/tmp/opencode/app-base`) was
   alive and held the `com.scaricatorediporto.app.SingleInstance` D-Bus name, so every later launch
   was treated as a second instance and exited at once. **When the app "exits immediately with no
   error", check whether a previous instance is still running** (`gdbus ... GetNameOwner`, `ps`).
2. **Wrong measurement device.** I concluded "the window renders, brightness 0.137" from
   `magick import`. That reads the X11 backing buffer and **bypasses the compositor**, so it was
   measuring memory, not the screen: the window was in fact black on screen. The real signal was
   the `Failed to create GBM buffer` line I had dismissed as harmless. **Capture through the
   compositor (`spectacle`) or trust the user's eyes, never `magick import`, for display bugs.**

### Decisions/deviations

D10 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`: the Wayland crash and the black window are worked around in the dev
launcher rather than "fixed" in the app, because the same crash happens with the unmodified Tauri
template.

## 2026-10-12 — M0-A / why the release binary and `npm run app` behaved differently

### Done

* **Owner asked why `./target/release/scaricatore-di-porto` did not start while `npm run app` did.**
  Measured, not guessed:

  | how it is launched | outcome | window | `Error 71` |
  | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
  | release binary, **no env vars** | **dies** | none | **1** |
  | release binary, `x11` + `no-dmabuf` | **alive** | yes | 0 |
  | debug binary (what `npm run app` runs), **no env vars** | **dies** | none | **1** |

  **The release binary is not broken.** Both binaries fail identically without the environment
  variables; `npm run app` only appeared to work because `scripts/run.mjs` injects them. The
  release binary also has the frontend embedded (no `Could not connect to 127.0.0.1`), because it
  was built with `--features tauri/custom-protocol`.
* **`scripts/run.mjs` replaces `scripts/run-dev.mjs`** and supports two modes, so both routes
  behave identically:
  * `npm run app` → `tauri dev` (Vite dev server + debug binary)
  * `npm run app:binary` → the compiled release binary; if it is missing it prints the right build
    command and warns that a bare `cargo build --release` is not enough.
* Verified: `npm run app:binary` → alive, window created, 0 `Error 71`, 0 GBM errors.

### Not verified / stubbed

* Still not verified by me that the window is visible **on screen** (the capture tool bypasses the
  compositor); the owner is the only one who can confirm the display bugs are gone.

### Next step

M0-B, unchanged.

## 2026-10-12 — M0-A / icons replaced with Lucide + settings persistence confirmed by the owner

### Done

* **Owner confirmed the settings round trip by hand**: language and theme changed in the UI survive
  closing and relaunching the app. This was the last unverified item of M0-A.
* **Owner reported the gear icon in the sidebar was malformed.** Root cause was my own method: the
  two sidebar icons were hand-written inline SVG `<path>` data recalled from memory. AGENTS.md §2.3
  ("Do not invent […] verify them") applies to SVG path data like any other value.
* **Replaced with `lucide-svelte` 1.0.1** (see DECISIONS.md D11): `download`, `list-video`,
  `settings`, imported individually from `lucide-svelte/icons/<name>`.
  * Still **inline SVG**, as spec §1 requires — no icon font, no remote asset.
  * **Tree-shaking measured, not assumed**: bundle 70.28 kB → 81.97 kB JS for three icons;
    `airplay` / `airplane` / `banana` / `trophy` absent from the bundle, the three used paths present.
  * **ISC licence** (Feather-derived icons MIT) — must appear in the About screen (spec §11.8, M7).
* Project rule recorded: never hand-write SVG path data.

### Verified by running

* Release binary rebuilt and captured: the sidebar now shows a correct gear, a correct
  list-with-play icon for **Coda**, and a correct download arrow in the brand. 980×680 as configured.
* `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` (32 + 5),
  `npm run check` (0 errors/warnings), `npm test` (28) — all green.

### Not verified / stubbed

* The icon set has **not** been exercised at small sizes on Windows/macOS, and only 3 of ~1600
  icons are in use; the rest get picked as the UI grows (M2 needs play/pause/folder/trash/retry).
* Still not verified by me: that the packaged window is visible **on screen** (see the previous
  block — the capture tool bypasses the compositor).

### Another of my mistakes: `cargo build --release` alone produces a useless binary

While rebuilding to screenshot the icons I got `Could not connect to 127.0.0.1` inside the release
app. Tauri decides dev-vs-dist with `dev: cfg!(not(feature = "custom-protocol"))`
(`tauri-macros/src/context.rs`), and **that feature is what `tauri build` turns on**. So:

```
cargo build --release                                      # compiles, runs, but loads devUrl -> broken
cargo build --release --features tauri/custom-protocol     # real standalone binary
npx tauri build                                           # the supported way
```

Recorded because it looks like a packaging bug and is not one.

### Next step

M0-B, unchanged.

## 2026-10-12 — M0-C item 8 (pulled forward) / cross-OS CI

### Done

* Owner asked how to test on Windows and macOS. Answer: only CI can do it from here; cross-
  compiling to Windows is possible but useless (the result cannot be run), and cross-compiling to
  macOS from Linux is impossible (needs Xcode + Apple SDK).
* **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` written** (spec §13.5), shaped around the owner's **private**
  repository and its minute budget (DECISIONS.md D12): lint+tests on Linux only at every push, the
  3-OS bundle matrix only when an artifact is actually wanted, and the Tier 2 targets
  (macOS Intel, Windows ARM64, Linux ARM64) only on `workflow_dispatch`.
* **`scripts/report-bundle-sizes.mjs`** puts the artifact sizes in the job summary (spec §1).
  Verified locally against a real bundle.

### Verified by running

* `npx tauri build` produces bundles on this machine: `.deb` **1,9 MiB**, `.rpm` **1,9 MiB**,
  `.AppImage` **108,0 MiB** (the AppImage is big on purpose — it embeds WebKitGTK, and spec §1
  excludes it from the size targets). App binary alone: **4,58 MiB**, under the ≤ 15 MB target.
* `scripts/report-bundle-sizes.mjs` reports exactly those numbers.
* `npm run check` (0 errors/warnings) and `npm test` (28) green; the workflow YAML has no tabs and
  parses into the expected jobs.

### Not verified / stubbed

* **The CI has never run.** The first execution is the real test. Most likely to need a fix: the
  Ubuntu system package list and the `universal-apple-darwin` build.
* No Windows or macOS build exists yet — nothing has been compiled for those targets.
* `scripts/fetch_bundled_tools.mjs`, `tools.manifest.json` and the sidecar job (spec §13.5 c) are
  still missing: they belong to M0-C, which is not finished.

M0-B, unchanged.
